Hello,

This will be a simple post. After a huge break of blogging, almost for like 8 years, I decided to start blogging once again.

Although I'm quite active on my [Twitter / X](https://twitter.com/ardadev) and recently on my self-hosted [Mastodon account](https://micro.arda.pw/@arda), I had always skipped blogging. It may be lack of interest, or maybe me sharing a lot more on social media nowadays.

However, if you can read this post, you could understand that I moved away from Medium.com, to this static bloc posting platform, Hugo.

These blog's source code is totally hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ardakilic/arda.pw), and built automatically using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). What it means is that every time I modify the repository (as in writing a new post, updating it, or changing any config etc.), it automatically is built statically and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

My initial plans are to share the configurations and document my self-hosted apps, and share some struggles, regardless of their difficulty to here.

I hope these changes will bring fresh blood to me, and to you as a reader.
