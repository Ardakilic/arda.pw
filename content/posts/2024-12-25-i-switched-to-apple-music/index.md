A couple of months ago, my old speaker set, [Logitech Z506](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VAK1FA), started to act funny.

Its volume was shifting randomly, from low to very high, then back to low. I was almost getting crazy why this was happening, and I tried to fix it by changing the potentiometer, reflowing the caps, but no luck. It was gone, now possibly in a recycling area.

At that point, I decided to upgrade my sound gear, and go for Hi-Fi.

I bought some gear to listen Hi-Fi music on the go and from my desktop. Got myself:

* An external sound card: [Focusrite Scarlet Solo Gen 4th](https://focusrite.com/products/scarlett-solo),
* External Monitor: [Presonus Eris E3.5](https://intl.presonus.com/products/eris-e35-studio-monitor),
* Studiı Headphones: [Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro, 250 Ohms](https://global.beyerdynamic.com/p/dt-770-pro),
* Some custom Cables for Balanced Output: First [Behringer GIC-90 4SR](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0013-AAP), then switched to some custom made cables from GuerGuo, [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006465852662.html),

And for mobile, got these:

* IEM: [KZ Saga](https://kz-audio.com/kz-saga.html), Bass Improved Version, since the difference between the bass improved and harman target was too low I wanted to go for it.
* Dac for USB-C: [Fiio Ka11](https://www.jadeaudio.com/XC2?product_id=71&_l=en)
* Dac for Lightning (and USB-C): Apple Dongle: [USB-C](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2Q3AM/A/) and [Lightning](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62ZM/A/)

With these equipments, I could really feel the difference between the Spotify High and my Bandcamp purcahses, especially with the basses and trebles so I wanted to go fully for the.
