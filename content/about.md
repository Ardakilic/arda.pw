# About Me

I'm a Software Engineer located in Istanbul, Turkey.

I've been developing applications since 2006 using various technologies.

I'm currently working as a Software Architect, and Staff Engineer at Teknasyon.

I love mechanical keyboards, fountain pens, micro controllers and hobby electronics in general.
